To set up LittleLink Custom, download the latest release from GitHub and simply put the folder 'littlelink-custom' in the root directory of your website.

That's it! No coding no command line setup just plug and play.

Now access your install of LittleLink Custom with 'your-domain-name.com/littlelink-custom'.

You can now log in to the Admin Panel with the credentials:
  email: admin@admin.com
  password: 12345678


Optional configuration:
Optionally, you can change the app name in your ".env" file in the root directory of your LittleLink Custom installation. At the moment this is set to
APP_NAME="LittleLink Custom" you can change "LittleLink Custom" to what ever you like. This setting defines the page title and welcome message.

Additionally, the littlelink-custom directory can be renamed to anything you see fit, further customizing your personal LittleLink Custom install.
